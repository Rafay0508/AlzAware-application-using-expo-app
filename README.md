# EarlyDetection Alzheimer's Disease App

Welcome to the EarlyDetection Alzheimer's Disease App GitHub repository!

This repository contains the source code and documentation for an innovative mobile application designed to aid in the early detection of Alzheimer's disease.

## Features

- **Data Collection:** The app collects various types of data, including cognitive test results, lifestyle factors, and health history, to build comprehensive user profiles.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Advanced machine learning models analyze the collected data to identify potential biomarkers and early signs of Alzheimer's disease.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The app features an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it accessible to both healthcare professionals and individuals concerned about their cognitive health.
- **Local Model Api:** Please note that the Model Api is not hosted live; it runs locally or using ngrok for development and testing purposes. The backend code is available in a separate repository ([Backend Repo](https://github.com/Rafay0508/AlzAware-application-api)).

## Getting Started

To get started with the app, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Set up the backend server either locally or using ngrok by following the instructions provided in the [Backend Repo](https://github.com/Rafay0508/AlzAware-application-api).
3. Install the necessary dependencies. use "npm install"
4. Run the app on your device or emulator.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from developers, researchers, and healthcare professionals interested in advancing the field of Alzheimer's disease detection. Whether you're a seasoned developer or new to the field, there are opportunities to contribute code, documentation, or testing feedback to help improve the app and make a meaningful impact on the lives of those affected by Alzheimer's disease.
